Implementation of the seminal experiment by Dr. Leonard Adleman - Molecular computations of solutions for combinatorial problems (Science, 1994)

This model takes a network as the input and returns the necessary DNA strands that needs to be synthesized in order to find the Hamiltonian Path in the network. The simulations are completely based on Adleman's paper.

On that note, let me explain my fascination on Molecular, escpecially DNA computation! 

It is amazing that biomolecules with such a miniature size, sustain life in this universe. But are they restricted to the biochemcical world? Hmmm... The answer is no! Starting from Leonard Adleman (in 1994), there have been tremndous efforts in manipulation of these biomolecules to also solve computationally challenging problems. Beginning with Adlemanâ€™s solution of a travelling salesperson problem using DNA, molecular computing has come a long way. Various kinds of computational challenges, such as solving NP-complete problems with many variables, logical computation, neural network operations, steganography and cryptography, have all been attempted through this unconventional approach. Techniques such as self-assembly, construction of renewable molecular circuits, and recording of intracellular events, have resulted in an array of tools and methodologies for molecular computation. Further, emergent behaviours, parallelism, energy efficiency, and the ability to tackle dead-locks offer cellular systems an upper hand over traditional silicon-based computation. Molecular computation, is indeed a field that challenges Science fiction! If you're reading this and you're interested in molecular computation, let's discuss more and plausibly collaborate!
