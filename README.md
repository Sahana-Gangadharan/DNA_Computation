# DNA_Computation

Implementation of the seminal experiment by Dr. Leonard Adleman - Molecular computations of solutions for combinatorial problems (Science, 1994)

This model takes a network as the input and returns the necessary DNA strands that needs to be synthesized in order to find the Hamiltonian Path in the network. The simulations are completely based on Adleman's paper.
